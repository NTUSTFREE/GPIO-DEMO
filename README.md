# GPIO-DEMO

- Description:

  This repo is used to store the file which I demo on LLD3.
  The application demonstrate 6 ioctl of our gpio driver, we could control gpio setting by this applicaiton.
  Here is the function we implement
  
   - Get GPIO direction.
   - Set GPIO direction as input.
   - Set GPIO direction as output.
   - Get GPIO data.
   - Set GPIO data to high.
   - Set GPIO data to low.
  
  e.g. When we enter "0 100"on terminal, it will Set GPIO number 100 as input ping.
  first argument is function and the secocnd argument is GPIO number.
